### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineer specializing in software engineering, passionate about software development, always aiming to satisfy my personal and professional growth. I'm focused on Typescript, Node.js, Golang, and Python. I've also worked with web development, in which I worked with Ruby and PHP. I have extensive experience working with REST and GraphQL APIs applications. I'm also interested in languages such as Elixir, Rust, Java, and all the new technologies in the market. Despite all back-end experience, I also spent a good time in the front-end working with React applications in the last years.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on @winnin.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning typescript and DDD.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on typescript, Golang, Python and Elixir projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music, anime and programming. ;D
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also known as a camiseta (t-shirt) among friends, co-workers and the software community.
